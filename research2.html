<h1>Communication in the discipline</h1>

<p>Communications in physics classroom are very important. Between professors and students, students and students, people need to communicate to each other to teach physics and learn physics. Physics, this discipline includes almost all the basic way of communication. People communicate by talking in physics. Professor talks to us by face to face to teach. We talk to each other in research and homework to learn. Listening carefully in the communication will help us to learn better and do better in Physics. Last but not least, the writing and reading are absolutely necessary in Physics. We need to write down records for lab and let others to read. Also students have to write and read to complete the homework and the test to learn physics better. </p>
	<p>Actually, a lot of graduate students are lack of a scientific education in physics. The demands of a scientific education mean that physics students have poorly developed written or oral communication skills. This is a very serious problem that the physics and the scientific community are facing. Some students write well but they cannot speak the subject in physical language to represent their results to audiences. Some are too anxious to share information when there are more than one audience. In another hand, some students do not know how to organize their research report and written work. Physics professors often spend a lot of time on correcting the language of a graduate report or thesis.  People just started to aware these kind of communication problems in physics class only a decade ago. </p>
	<p>There are certain ways to help a student to develop his communication skill no matter on writing or speaking.  More participations in some college activities can help a physics student be more outgoing and get better on his speaking skill. Writing formal blogs and essays can help a physics student develop his writing skill. The communication in physics actually is related to the communication in other classes. Physics students always can get benefits on improving their communication in physics class from their efforts in other classes, like writing classes or classes with presentation projects. </p>
