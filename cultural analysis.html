<font color="black"><h1>Culture Analysis Proposal Activity</h1><img src="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wvtf/files/201304/cell-phones%20%26%20hands_0.jpg">
<p><span>Since</span> people knew how to speak, we started to communicate. There is an advantage about human beings, we are never satisfied with current situations. Our solution to this problem is to approach sciences and the world alike with the ideology of always improving, even when our technologies seem up to date. </p>
<p>People around the world have found different ways to communicate over time. Basic postal services, which primarily started around 550 B.C., took a drastic change when the Chinese developed a smoke signal system to transmit a message as far as 750 kilometers quick and efficiently. In 19th century America, Pony Express, a poster express on horseback was invented and reduced the time for messages to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about ten days. After the development of semaphore, Morse code and typewriter, the telephone was invented in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell. From there, the telephone was made mobile by John F. Mitchell and Dr. Martin Cooper, who created the first Motorola cellular device in 1973. Since then, communication via telephone has evolved immensely, and continues to grow until today. </p>
<p>In almost a generation, cell phones have become a fixture in our lives. We take our phones everywhere we go. Specifically, with a population of about 63 million in United States of America, there are an astonishing 81.6 million mobile subscriptions. </p>
<p>As the development of social networks, 3G, 4G, and all kind of applications People are getting more and more addicted to the cellphone. We are getting a better and more convenience way day by day to communicate to each other. We don’t actually even need to talk or listen to communicate if we want. All we need to do is to send a message by moving our fingers on the keyboard and wait to do the same thing again and again. </p>
<p>Although cellphone does a lot of good jobs for our life, it also bring some bad consequences. Just like a coin has two sides, the cellphone is causing social issue for us while it is helping us to communicate quickly. People, especially kids are losing their manners in communication because using too much cellphone; People are getting worse on their vocabulary and starting to use abbreviated words on text massages; more and more people become less outgoing because of cellphone. Because of the convenient we get from cellphone, now we have to pay the price. We are actually losing our nature, our skills to communicate. People don’t know how to communicate anymore by using too much cellphone. </p> <img src="http://www.truthdig.com/images/cartoonuploads/cellphone_500.jpg">
<p> “I have sat in a lot of meetings where people don’t look each other in the eye. People drop in and out the conversation. This drives me crazy. I have an old-fashioned view that people are supposed to talk to each other,” as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg Spoke on LBC Radio. He thinks our sense of good manners is suffering because of telephones. </p>
<p>I agree with his point of view between the telephone and the good manner because people, especially children and young adolescents are losing their manners in communication when they are required to talk face to face. Too much relying on cellphone communication, we seems no longer need to talk to each other face to face. All we need to do to talk to someone is by sending a text or just by a call. Because of the freedom that the cellphone gives to us, we can say all the things we want including bad language, lies and vicious talk in the cellphone conversation without worry. We all know as long as we stay in our room and no one is around us, any language and any manner for phone communicating will be ok. This will bring us a bad manner and a bad habit for conversation. </p>
<p>It’s not that hard for adults to keep their good manners when they come to face to face talk. But it is not easy for the young people to change back to a good manner since they are used to the free cellphone talk. It’s always easier to learn bad things than to learn good things.  Because of bad manner raised by cellphone talking, we are spoiled to speak at our own wills. The bad manner habit in cellphone talking e would give us a greater chance to make mistakes when it comes to face to face conversation. We might lose our politeness or our restrain in talking and cause problem sometime in the conversation. We might hurt someone’s feeling unconsciously. May be a missing “excuse me” or a “hey” instead of “name or Dr.” and etc.” would start a bad conversation without noticing or hurt someone’s feeling. People might fail at their interviews in jobs or teams. It’s a serious problem! You may think your phone conversation’s manner is as good as you face to face conversation’s manner. That’s good for you and you should keep the good manner. But if you think your face to face conversation is as “go-as-you-please” as your phone conversation. It’s probably the time to be aware and change. </p>
<p>College student are getting worse and worse in their vocabulary and writing because of cellphone. People, especially students are used to abbreviated words because they text too much massage daily. Some students don’t even know how to talk each other anymore. College students who frequently text message during class have difficulty staying attentive to classroom lectures and consequently are at risk of having poor results, according to a study by Fan-Yi Flora Wei, Ken Wang and Michael Klaussner at the University of Pittsburgh, published in the journal Communication Education. The Doctors also say “Working with college students has shown them how their communication, written and spoken has suffered. They receive emails with no greetings or signatures, text-speak abbreviations, no capitals or punctuation. The emails they are sending are important ones, and they look like a kindergartner wrote them. It is even showing up in admission and scholarship applications! It comes out even more (if possible) in their inability to have a mature verbal confrontation with their roommates or friends. Roommate agreements explode with no attempt at resolution before students are texting parents, parents are calling me, and the answer to the question, "Have you told your roommate this bothers you?" Is almost always "....No." Students can’t even talk to each other to solve the problem together because of their bad social skill affected by the cellphone. </p>
It is so frustrating, and each year this communication breakdown is getting worse. I think this it is another reason that we don’t know how to communicate anymore with the right words and sentences because of cell phone. Can you imagine that people in the office hate their formal document because they are used to abbreviated words in cellphone talking or reading.
<p>Because we can call anyone in a second no matter how far away they are, the convenient of cell phone conversation causes us to lose our face to face conversation skills. Yonsei University in South Korea developed a research model of mobile voice communication on the basis of the social skills deficit hypothesis. In the model, poor social skills were related to less face-to-face and mobile voice communication, which was linked to greater loneliness. Structural equation modeling analyses of survey responses from 374 adults supported the social skills deficit hypothesis in that poor social skills were related to less involvement in face-to-face communication and greater loneliness. Also, as expected, more face-to-face interactions were associated with lower levels of loneliness; however, more cell phone calling was associated with greater loneliness. Additional regression analyses revealed that the positive relationship between mobile voice communication and loneliness was more pronounced for those who have more friends than those who have fewer friends. If people have cell phones, we don’t need to walk to their faces then talk to them. People start to become less outgoing and some people turns out to be shy and lonely.  Being used to talk to old friends on the phone, some people will feel having difficulties to have a good conversation with strangers. They will want to avoid face to face conversation. And we call this behavior as “Being shy”. Actually, I am in one of these kind of people. I am alright when it is cell phone conversation because I don’t have to see people’s faces and I know can’t get hurt. But when it comes to the real conversation, I become shy and don’t know what to say. Because cellphone conversation and the real face to face conversation are two totally different situations. Now I realize when it comes to face to face conversation the cellphone gives me no help but harm.
.	<p>Cellphone, this culture artifact has caused a serious problem and this problem would get worse if we don’t do anything.  People don’t know how to communicate anymore because of cellphone using. People are getting bad manners on talking because of cellphone using; College students are getting bad vocabulary and bad writing skill because of cellphone using; more and more teenagers are getting less outgoing. What should we do about this?
<p>I don’t think we can absolutely avoid cellphone. Because cellphone has its good advantages. But we should always be aware to the bad consequences that the cellphone talking or texting would bring to us. We should use more complete words and sentences in texting to keep our vocabulary in shape. We should keep our good manner in cellphone talking either with friends or family. Also we need to do is to put down the cellphone sometimes and talk to people around by face to face. Do not only talk to your old friends for improving your social skills. While you are practicing your social skill with your old friends, you should try some new friends. It will help you a lot. As my experience, I am not a social person. After I came to MSU. I decided to be more social. I tried to talk to my new roommate and other new friends. I tried to spend a lot of quality time with real people instead of holding a phone. I feel a lot of better now than before. I start to realize face to face conversation is what I need to get out of shy and loneliness. What cellphone does to me is totally opposite. Comparing to cellphone communication, face to face conversation does require more time and certain places. We should not be lazy. We should go out and take our time to talk with each other face to face. The most important thing is make sure you have fun. I think you will have fun with the real conversation and you also will realize how beautiful this world is and how beautiful everyone is  after you walk out of the shadow of cellphone and start face to face conversation. </p></font>
