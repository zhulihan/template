<h1>WRA 110 Course Retrospective Project</h1>
<p>WRA 110 is not a normal writing course like the ones we had in high school. Besides writing, students have to learn how to use html code to make their own webs for the writing. Researching and reading skills are also required in this course. In WRA 110, we are required to complete six activities and to make our own website for the final. All projects which we have done in the class are required to be showed in a cool DIY website. I have already said this is not a "normal" writing class. It comes with challenges and fun. </p>
<p>Let me introduce the first tool we use in this writing class, Codecademy. It's a website with the program which teaches you how to make an html website step by step. Codecademy is a very useful tool for us to get knowledge on using html codes and making website. I learnt most of the website making skills from this Codecademy. It's actually helpful and not that boring.  I think you can find some fun by learning how to make cool website, like websites with colorful pictures, cool videos, magnificent backgrounds and etc. Github is an app which help you to arrange all your changes in your website. You should keep in mind that after you confirm the change in the Github, you have to click "sync" or it won't show any changes on your website. </p>
<p>We upload our drafts to a website called Eli review. It's a website helping students and teachers to share their ideas about all drafts which we have done.  Uploading the draft won't be the only work you need to do on the Eli review. After uploading the draft, you might or might not receive other students' drafts for you to grade and give advices. If you receive some drafts, please grade them carefully and give some useful advices. Because a lot of advices I received were useless. Don't write anything like "Good job". It's not helpful for the person you are grading. The fact is what people really want is to improve their essay not receiving compliments. For those students who have not received others' drafts, all you need to do is to be patient and wait. If you haven't received any of the draft from others after deadline, you don't need to be worried. You won't lose any credits for that. The reason you don't have the draft to grade is because some of the students forget to turn in their drafts before the deadline. </p>
<p>After the uploading and grading progress.  We will receive some advices from some other students. It's very important to read them. The reason why is because we are going to write a revision plan of the project. You should remember revision plan worth credits and it's a very important thing to do before you start to write your paper. You should not write this plan too short or you will lose points. The best way to write a revision plan is to rewrite an outline for your paper after you reading all the advices. </p>

<p>We have four main course assignments:
<p>1. Lived experiences         3. Formal research</p>
<p>2. Cultural analysis      4. Remix project      </p>
<p>Live experience is a assignment required you to write about your major and one technology which inspired you to choose you major. The most important thing is since this live experience project is a narrative essay, the authenticity is the first requirement of this project. My advice for you is to write a real story about yourself instead of faking one. It did take me a while to think about a particular technology to talk about. My essay is about Television and Chemical Physics. It didn't lie about anything in the essay because television is the technology which grows up with me. I think it is reasonable. It's always easier to write if the student want to write a true story, too. In this assignment, you should never forget to talk about the technology which inspired your major. The technology is the key in this paper. I didn't talking too much about my major. I think the project should focus on the experience. If the particular technology is not showed in your live experience essay, you won't get a good grade. I read some others' live experience essays online before I started to write. The articles I read online actually give me some inspiration for writing this project. </p>
<p>Cultural analysis is an assignment requiring us to talk about one social issue and one technology which causes the issue. The thing we need to remember is to write about the social issue and the technology. They should be related to each other in the article. Don't write two things are totally not related. Making Cultural analysis to be logical an understandable is important. After deciding the technology and the social issue you want to write about, enough researches about these two objects are required before you start to write the essay. I think it will be better and easier for you to write about some common technology like cellphones, televisions, speakers and etc. My topic is about the bad influence of cellphone on in-person communication. I think the common technology can make audience easier to understand my topic. </p>
<p>In my mind, research paper is always long, boring and useless. But after complete this formal research project, I totally change my old perspective. This research project is like super useful for me. The Formal research in WRA 110 is a project focuses on telling people about a discipline. It's not required that the student has to write his own major. We can write about a discipline which has no connection with the major you are working on right now. But it is a good choice to write about our own majors. Doing this Formal research about ours own major can help us get a better understanding about our majors and it might help us to reconsider about majors we are having right now. For this project, I did a lot of research work for the major. Professor suggest us to use the MSU e-library. This e-library is a very powerful tool for researching information. It is like a big bank of resource. I tried different key words of my major to do research. Every different key word I typed in gave me its own new information. </p>
<p>Multimedia Remix project is an assignment requiring students to do a documentary on a topic which was used in the last three projects. This project is different than the projects I talk about previously. Multimedia Remix project is done in group. Since it is depending on teamwork, choosing group members will be a very important part for you to do before you start anything on this project. I think this project might will be either easy or hard for you depending on who you find to work with. If you find someone who is irresponsible, the project will be difficult for you. In another hand, if you can find someone who is willing to do the work with passion, you will find out this project is actually easy. With good teammates, you will accomplish better work and learn more things. It's not a good choice to do it by yourself because it will be a lot of work. After grouping, you need to schedule the time to do the project. As a group project, you should give enough your time to your group. You should never try to do this project in last second since it takes a lot of time to do. Choosing a good topic for the documentary is important. An interesting topic for a documentary can easily catch audiences' eyes. </p>
<p>Course retrospective is a reflection of this course. It is also a project requiring you to give some advices to the students who are going to take WRA 110.  It good to try you best to help people out. You should never forget to keep your blog on track or you have to make all of them up at the end of the semester. It's a good idea to write down the blog after the professor show you the video or the movie. You should never start your project on the due day. Because every single one of the project requires a lot of work and time. It will not be smart to be the last second man in this class. </p>
<p>As a student who speaks English as a second language, I really want to say few things for the upcoming international student. Although you will have some difficulties in this class, it is always good for asking help. Don't try to figure out thing by yourself. You should always ask people around you at the first moment you need help. It's a bad idea trying to make thing up after you notice you have already passed the deadline. Since the class only meets once a week, if you have any questions, you should always email the professor for asking help. It is very important for every student to go to the class every week. Although you can check all agendas online, it will be easier and more clear for you to understand the project if you go to the class. </p>
