<h1>Way of learning in Physics class and researches in physics </h1>
			
<p>Way of building knowledge in the physics class</p>

<p>It's important to recognize that physics is a problem-solving discipline. In the physics classroom, Physics professor always do is giving stress major themes and principles. One major goal for a physics student is that he will be able to apply these principles to understand and solve problems. Physics students should focus on the fact, that in a physics course, students are required to learn the skills for solving physics questions. </p>

<p>Pre-view the physics textbook is a very good idea to start this discipline. Physics student should read the introduction of the chapter before the class as a preview. Skipping the small notes on the side of the textbook is not a good move. These notes always contain good example or ways to help student understand the language. Most professor have their own PowerPoint for each chapter. It will be very helpful if student can read the PowerPoint before the class.  Taking the course with a perspective early from the preview, reviewing important themes and principles again in the course will help a physics student build his physics language better. </p>
<p>In the physics, taking good notes is a good habit for a physics student no matter in the class or a lab. Underline the basic concepts and formulas will give physics student a hint that they are the important knowledge to review.  It's important to draw pictures in the notes to understand the questions for physics. When the student copy drawings, completeness is worth more than careful artwork. Student should not only copy what is on the board but also record important points that the teacher makes orally about the diagram. The picture shows below will be a good example for the drawings in the note.</p>

<p> It's easy to draw and it's easy to understand and be reviewed after class. </p>
<p>Sometime students would get behind in their note-taking. Leaving a space in the notes and go on is not a bad thing to do.  Students can fill in your notes later with the help of a classmate or your textbook Asking questions in physics classroom is very important. Don't be embarrassed to ask the professor questions. Many physics professor depend on feedback from students to help them set a proper pace for the class. Sometime professes might make mistakes on the board. Asking will help students avoid misunderstanding.  </p>
<p>Based on the result we got earlier, 10% of students can remember an important knowledge from the lecture they heard only 15 minutes ago. After a physics class, review is necessary. An immediately small review on the notes after class will help a physics student consolidate his knowledge of concepts and theories that he heard from the class. Physics students will need not rewrite the notes. Summarize these in the margin or on the opposite side if student has taken notes only on one side, and at this time he may want to add an outline to the notes. Also, this would be a good time to integrate notes from textbook into lecture notes; then the student will have one set of integrated notes to study by.  </p>
<p>Review by reading is not enough for a physics student to build his physics knowledge well. Physics knowledge is not just about the concepts and theories. The most important fact of this discipline is building knowledge and skills to solve physics problems. Doing a lot of practice in homework is necessary for a physics student. </p>
<p>As a physics student review his notes, certain questions may come to mind. Leave space for recording questions, and then either ask the teacher or even better, try to answer these questions with friends and with the help of the text. </p>
<p>Research plays a very important role in Physics. There are four ways to get started in physics research as a physics student: post-secondary educational training, research assistant positions, reviewing academic journals, and referrals.  The first place to look for information about getting started in physics research is in university or college. Student can talk to his career or program counselor, research services, his faculty liaison officer, or administrative program manager. They are the people who can advise students about the different options available, skill level required for the various roles, and what qualifications are necessary. </p>
<p>Although research is very important in physics, not all the students can do research in this discipline. To work in a physics research program, there are certain academic credentials that must be met. Student has to have at least bachelor's degree to be involved in the program. </p>
