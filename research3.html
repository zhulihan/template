<h1>Technology and Physics</h1>
	
<p>Physics professors found that integrating technology into the classroom has allowed them to help the physics students in ways that were never before possible. Using new technology like a powerful software or a smart board for teaching physics, Physics professors have seen students get interested and start to understand the class information that is given to them in ways that would have taken a lot longer time without the proper use of technology. Some physics teachers use technology just for the sake of using the technology. Sometime technology can be misused I physics course, it becomes a distraction rather than a tool. </p>
<p>A study done with two groups of students will help us to understand how important role technology is playing in Physics course. One group was given traditional lectures while the other group was given traditional lectures and computer simulations. The group that was given computer simulations performed much better on a test given after the lesson. The computer simulations they were using were from the Interactive Physics suite of applets and they were focusing on Newtonian motion. The questions that the students in the experimental group were asked were more conceptual than mathematical. These questions were mainly questions based on misconceptions that students typically have when coming into physics and are generally tough to change in students’ heads. </p>
<p>For most students in physics classes, they cannot remember the knowledge which is presented in the physics lectures well and they always turn into held on to their own misconceptions. In one research, only 10% of students can remember an important knowledge from the lecture they heard only 15 minutes ago. The technology, internet and the software program can improve the physics classroom’s teaching quality through the use of electronic communication, practices, and virtual physics simulations. The students actually experience the discipline rather than just hear about it by using new technology in physics class. The technology way of teaching allows for a physics student to shift his way of thinking and learning rather than possibly misinterpreting what the lecturer is trying to say. </p>
<p>Most physics professors supports the use of technology way of teaching in their classroom. There are lot of internet website and software for physics teaching. For example Socrative is a free service that allows for instant feedback using the students existing mobile devices rather than the clickers.  Almost all of the research that the traditional lecture based physics class is not as effective as an interactive classroom supported by the technology. Lectures can be enhanced, using available technology, to be more interactive and get the students more engaged. </p>
