<main><h1 style="font-family:cursive"> Lived experiences project: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_physics">Chemical Physics</text></a>, Television and I<align="middle></h1>

<p>This Lived experiences project is written not only for you but also for me. It will help you know my Chemical Physics major better and know me better. For example, analyzing the questions like <front color="#00FF00">What is my major?</font>, <front color="#00FF00">What careers my major will cause me turn in to?</font> will give you some information and views about Chemical Physics. This project also can help me get some confidence about my major. Because not only I am going to tell the audiences the reason that I choose the major but also telling myself the reason. In another word, I have to pursue myself before telling the benefits about my major to others. I will be focusing on trying to argue why I choose my major and what technology impacted me to choose my academic path.</p>
<P>My major is Chemical Physics. Being a Chemical Physical student, I will combine the study of physical chemistry with atomic and molecular physics to focus on the structures and structural changes of substances and topics of instruction include quantum theory, classical mechanics, and the rate of chemical reactions, laser physics, and more.</p>
<p>I still remember my favorite high school Physics teacher said “Chemistry and Physics are in the same family.” on one of his classes. Although Chemistry and Physics are totally two different courses, they cannot be without each other. I think the best way to learn science is to learn both physics and chemistry. My major sometimes will be confusing with the major Physical Chemistry and I was very confused about these two majors. They sounds like familiar to me but actually they are different. After doing some research, I realize Chemical Physics is a major will be focusing on Physics, researching and explaining the chemical process by Physics ways. In another hand, Physical Chemistry will be focusing more on Chemistry, researching and explaining the Physics reaction in a Chemistry process. In an easy way of explaining, the Chemical Physicist will be a Physicist first and a Chemist second; Physical Chemist will be a Chemist first then Physicist.</p>
  <P>	If you want me to think about a technology which impacts me on choosing my major, it will be one of the most common technologies, the Television. The first electronic television was invented by Philo Farnsworth and Charles Francis Jenkins in early 1920s. With the time pass, this old machine black and white frame now has been improve to be every family’s 3D, liquid crystal treasure.</p><img src="http://dishtv.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Black-and-White-TV.jpg"> <img src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1162284!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/watch18tvf-1-web.jpg">
<p>When I was in elementary school, television has already been in this world such a long time being a tool belong to human for entertainment, business and advertisement. The where I went, the where I could see at least one television there. Television’s development is amazing. Recently I went to Best Buy, the big televisions there are like 52”or even bigger. Thinking back, what I had when I was like 5 years old was a small maybe 20” television. But it still gave me a lot of fun and taught me a lot things about science and the nature. </p>
<p>I was never an athletic kid. What I liked to do when I had free time was to watch television at home, and with some ice cream will be better. I was so addicted to the television. I can focus on the television from the sunrise to sunset. Television was a big part of my life before I started to use the computer.</p>
<p>When I was little, I loved to ask questions. Of course, none of my questions were like Edison or Newton’s. But I did like to ask questions. My elementary teacher used to call me “Mr.100 thousand why” because I always would use “Why” to start the conversation with her. Sometime people would get so annoying by my questions. My best friends even wanted to paunch me in the face. </p>
<p>There was one day, my father got us a television. I remembered how I get so excited that day and threw a bunch of questions to my Dad when we were watching the TV, “Why do this thing have active motion picture on it? Why it can make sound? How does it ok?” My Dad answered all my questions by one sentence only, “it’s because science, and you will learn more information by watching instead of asking. Later on, by watching TV, I kind of adjusted my “asking questions” habit and also started to learn knowledge observing things around me. </p>
    <p>Without TV shows and News, television is just a big metal box. But because of this big metal box, people can receive the TV shows and News. Television is a big resources bank. I can get varies information from this bank. Television taught me more about news, society and science than I learn from the text book. A lot of deep meaning things I talked to my parents on the dinner table which seemed like classes’ production, were actually mostly from the television.</p>
<p>Most the intelligent story and discover I copied from TV to my parents were the Science stories and theories. Besides the crazy comedic channels and news channels, I love to watch Science channels on TV. There’s a good thing about TV. No matter time changes, TV will always give a position to play some science education channel. Back then, there was a show called Discovery. I still remember the easiest but amazing experiment in Discovery. The scientist took off the hard board which was covering the opening of an upside down water cup carefully and the water would still stay in the cup for few seconds before fell. Although I understand now the principle of that experiment, I am still very thankful to the show and the TV to give me the curious attitude to learn science.</p>
<p>There is another show which I like to watch called Myth Buster. It’s on Discovery Channel. If you like to watch the Discovery Channel, you must have watched this show before. In the show, “Myth Buster” Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. Although the rumors and myths sometimes sound crazy and ridiculous, I will find the answer under Adam and Jamie’s experiment.</p> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Q7f-IPf0HTo/TRz6JvZ-imI/AAAAAAAAAng/SBSfXA5Kizk/s1600/mythbusters.jpg"><iframe width="400" height="225" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uULn_Jul43Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
<p>Because of the television and varies interesting science show, I started to like observing the nature and world when I was little. I want to know the nature better and science better; I want to be the scientist like Adam Savage and Jamie doing crazy experiment with a group of people; I want to invent technology amazing like TV; I want to contribute myself by science. </p>
<p>Science is very important for the society. There are a lot of problem in this world right now such as the greenhouse, air pollution, non-recyclable resources and etc.” waiting for science to solve.  Everyone knows that science can make the world better. Without science, the society won’t develop this quickly and people’s conditions won’t be as good as now. The society needs science and science needs people to learn and use. I know Chemistry and Physics can help me to get better on science. That is the reason I choose Chemical Physics as my major.</p>
