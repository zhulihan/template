<h1>Interview</h1>
			
<p>Interview with Professor Huss. </p>
<p> Mr. Huss is my physics teacher for my junior year in Phoenix Christian High school. He is a professor on both chemistry and physics. By calling him on the phone for a phone interview, I summarize some questions and answers. </p>
<p>Why do you like physics, this discipline? </p>
<p>God creates the world. Physics helps me to know this world better. So I can know God better. </p>
<p>What can I do after I graduate as a physics major student? </p>
<p>It’s better for you to continue studying for PhD degree then get a job. It will be fine if you want to find a job without PhD degree, physics has a wide career range. Anything which is related to physics would give you an opportunity for a job. You can anticipate in building and structures, energy, transports, education all kind of fields. But it will easier to find a job with PhD degree. </p>
<p>What Skills Do I Need to Study Physics? How can I improve my Physics? </p>
<p>Mathematics will be a tool for Physics.  With good mathematics knowledge will help you to get better understanding in physics. </p>
<p>All science are related. Study other fields of science, such as biology and chemistry will get you a different view of physics and understanding of it. </p>
<p>Interview with an elder classmate who study physics, Ray Zhang. </p>
<p>Why do you choose physics as your major? </p>
<p>I can still be a business man without learning business in college. But science major like physics will give you real knowledge which will go along with you for the whole life. </p>
<p>Do you think physics is hard to learn? </p>
<p>It depends on person. If you work hard and you have a good logical way of thinking. I don’t think it will be hard for you. </p>
<p>How to learn physics better? </p>
<p>You should take a good notes from the class for reviewing. Don’t ever copy homework from other. Physics needs your own way of thinking to solve the questions. You should do a lot of practice. Practice will help you to remember the way of solving questions. </p>
