<h1>MEMO</h1><li><a href="work.html"><h2>work cited</h2></a></li>
	
<p>This memo is a reflection of explaining and analyzing the choices of my group made to revise and mediate our work on reaching audiences and achieving group's purpose, and my feelings after doing the remix project, 'Disconnect to Connect'.
Composing in Context
The issue we choose is about the bad influence of cellphone talking on face-to-face conversation. We want to show the audience that cellphone talking does affect their life. By collecting data and videotaping, I started to get to know the issue truly and had a better understanding on the topic. The problem I faced was how to arrange the time for each components and how to use a clear way to express the theme. Audiences will be the judge of the documentary, all I want to do is to convince them to agree my theme.
<p><u>Process</u></p> 
The topic is the most important part of the process. Without a good topic, anything comes after would be difficult to decide. Discussing about the topic, we had disagreements. Everyone got different point of views, but there was one thing we had the agreement on was that we decided not to do a remix on the formal research paper. Because we thought neither audiences nor us would be interested on a remix project of majors. After the choice of not writing about formal research papers, all we left was to decide the topic between lived experiences report and cultural analysis proposal. We found out that cultural analysis proposals' topics are more interesting than live experiences reports'. We decided to choose topic along those essays. Fatin's topic is about bad influence of fast food. Joshua’s topic is about medical care. My topic is about cellphone's bad influence on real world conversation. Since medical and fast food would be pretty hard for us to act and explain to audience, we decided to do the project on the cellphone effects. I think we made a good choice about the topic because it would be easier for us to talk about cellphone since most of audiences have one. It would be easier for audiences to understand the documentary through the common thing they use every day.
The most challenging part of the project for us is to videotape a short scene which can help audience to understand the theme. People could understand the theme easily in few minutes video scene rather than reading all the stats we gave to them over again and again. Since we all are bad actors, the video took us a big amount of time. We had to redo it again and again about 10 times. I think it was the most challenging part of the project but it was also the most interesting part of the project.
<p><u>Research</u></p>
	I think the most beneficial resources for me and my group are the statistic data. Because the audience will get a better understanding on the topic by watching charts and numbers instead of reading long paragraphs. The least beneficial resources are the articles about the cellphone. Articles takes a lot of time to read and sometimes they might be having the wrong ideas comparing to my topic. Personally, I prefer to use statistic data.
<p><u>Collaboration</u></p>
I think the group of three was a good choice because there would never be a tie on a decision. Everyone is cooperative in my group. We all took our times on the project. I am so glad that I choose to do it in a group not individually. It saved everyone a lot of time to do this project and group work was fruitful for every one of us.

<p><u>Project Management</u></P>
I think we did not have a good work plan. We didn't even have a good time seclude for each members. Since no one knows how long the project would take, we did our best staying as long as enough time with each other to finish the group work. It was so stressful and boring to have such a long group meeting. If I have another chance to do the project, I will divide those long meetings into several short meetings. I think it would be less stressful for everyone.
We didn't arrange the work equally. Since Joshua and Fatin's English are better than me, they decided to do more work. All I did was videotaping parts, and gave them advices about the project. I am very thankful that they didn't give me a lot of work to do but I did want to contribute more.
<p><u>Documentary Design</u></p>
I think we did a good job on arranging resources we had. We proved our theme and showed audiences the topic from different angles, including statistic data, interview, music and short film. The arrangement of these units gives the audience a deep impact on the topic from watching, listening and understanding. We designed to put short film first because we think a film will be a good start for the audience getting in touch with the topic. Then we put data to reflect the film. Finally we use film again to end the video and leave a deep influence on audience.
