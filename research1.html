<h1>Introduction: Physics & Potenial Career</h1>
			
<p>Physics, as a very important branch of science is a study of matter, energy, and the interaction between them, including the subjects about mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.  Another way to explain physics is that physics is about meaningful questions and answers. The process about asking fundamental questions and trying to answer questions by observing and experimenting is physics. The question "How did universe begin?", "where the subject will be in certain time"and "what are the basic building blocks of matter?" all are example questions in physics.</p> 		
<p>Scientists, who do research in physics are called physicists.  A physicist will be participated in a wide range of physical phenomena researches. Physicists are the people who will be observing, experimenting to answer the meaningful questions in physics. Many of physicists will only work in "pure" research, trying to answers question and makes some theoretical concepts. Their researches' results will often lead to unexpected technological application. For example, the updating theoretical understanding of electrons will help the electronic industry to make new phones, and other electronic productions.  Almost all human activities are applied by the theoretical concepts in physics. Energy production, treating cancer, through radiotherapy, and diagnosing illness through various types of imaging, computer games, sports equipment and every sector you can think about are basically all based on physics. Don't think people with physics degree will all turn out be a physicists working in researching field. Physics has a wide career region. Students with physics degrees can participate variety jobs in Sports and games, space, medicine, music and television, cutting edge, environment, building and structures, transports, energy, education, even in law and finance. It may not very obvious for people to understand the relationship between physics and law. Actually, a physics education is important to law - forensics requires a detailed understanding of how objects move and the forces involved when analyzing the scene of a crime or accident. In generally speaking, people have many choices to choose their jobs with physics. </p>
<p>From reading some scholarly journals and magazines with physics topics, I get more information about this discipline. Although a short magazine report "Careers for Physics Majors" which is written by Styron, Regina was written by two decades ago, the report still have the significant value to talk about. The information about the state of career available to physics is detailed including several famous physicists' annotation in this tractate. </p>
<p>According to Nation Science Foundation, the society really and truly needs the people with degree of science. The Nation Science Foundation back then predicted a shortage of 400,000 scientists by 2006. Dr. Kennedy Reed, president of the National Society of Black Physicists and a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory said "As we approach the next century, there's going to be an even greater need for physicists. Those who are trained and ready should find excellent opportunities awaiting them."</p>
<p>Physics can turn into work with a lot of other major including acoustics, astrophysics, biophysics, optics, electro-magnetism as well as atomic, nuclear, plasma, and solid-state. Each of these discipline needs physics' acknowledge and cooperation. The physics' career range are wide. There are so many sub-disciplines requiring physicist to work with them. 
The application of physics in work world is virtually limitless. As physicists, people can participate from a project on making a small computer chip to a project on developing new energy sources. The physics' work will take a lot of time to accomplish. This time range and work schedule should be a necessary thing to consider about during the application of the career. Because different physics careers will have different projects requiring different time. Projects can range anytime from five month to fifteen years or more in duration. </p>
<p>A scholarly source from "What You Can Do With a Physics Major After Graduation " which was  written by Pennsylvania  state university are going to give some more detail information to consider about the potential physics careers. </p>
<p>Most college students will concern about the job market they will encounter after graduation. The job market will be here depended sensitively on the major chosen by the students. Many Physics students will have an idea that eventually they will be professional physicists. However, no everyone will be a professional physicist at the end. But for those planning to be "professional physicists," an advanced degree (generally a Ph.D.) is required. Most physics students will use their Bachelor's degree as a springboard to other careers like the careers in industry, education, medicine, or other areas. </p>
<p>Indeed, the American Physical Society recently found that less than 2% of its membership was unemployed (although not all of the employed members described themselves as professional physicists).People need more time having education and preparing for Physics careers than they apply to other careers. Most people need 4-7years after college to be actually entering the job market. "Do what interests you and what you are good at." Is a very good advice to undergraduates at this stage seems to be if they don't know what they want to do in the future. </p>
