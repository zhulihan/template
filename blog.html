<h3>#1.First Day</h3>
First day of the writing class. I want to tell everyone that I am not a good writer. I am kind of nervous about this class. I don't think it will be easy for me to get a good grade. This class is super long too. It will take more than an hour. After the first lesson, I start to realize besides writing, we need to create a website too. That sounds fun to me because I am very "good" at editing html!

<h3 style="color:yellow">#2. It Gets Better</h3><div align="middle"><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KYa0wi4XzeI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p> The purpose of the is to express his love and miss on his uncle. He also wants to encourage gay people no matter now or later having difficulty should keep believing in life. And he wants to tell them everything will get better!
<p> Author plays some shots of several blackboard with some sentences about what he is going to speech. Then he expresses his miss on his uncle by telling people his letter as a speech in the video. In another way to say is that author uses pictures first to give us a foresight. Then he plays his video speech for his main purpose</p>		
<p> This Video's structure teaches me that I can use different ways like writing, showing picture or music to express my purpose about my life experience project.

<h3>#3. Living Experience Project</h3>
<p>Living experience is a project writing about my major and a technology inspired me to choose the major. Since it is a narrative project. I have to write about my life story. It is so hard to think about a specific technology to write about. After a long time of struggling, I decide to write about TV because TV is really my favorite technology and it does teach me a lot of knowledge out of the text book. This easy is actually not that hard than I think. After finishing the essay, I use the technic which I learnt from the Codecademy to put my essay into html form. It took me a while but I am so glad that I finished in one day.

<h3 style="color:blue">#4. The Social Network</h3>
<div aligan="middle"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lB95KLmpLR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></main>
<p>Today we watched a movie in the class called The Social Network. I like this kind of movie talks about how a person successes his life. But instead of saying how good social network is, I want to talk about some bad part of the social network. I think this social network can hurt people especially girls. For example, in the movie, Mark Zkerberg posted sorority's girls' pictures on the social network for people to grade and entertain. This move can hurt a lot of girl and in the real life, people are doing things like this every day. This move encroach girls right badly. I think although social network help people to communicate easier, we should really think before we post something and hurt people's feeling. </P>

<h3># 5.Another project</h3>
<P>Cultural Analysis is a project wants us to talk about a social issue which is cause by a specific technology. The first mind came to me was that the video game like Call of duty, Battle Warfare can make a person more violent. I did some research about this topic but it turned out that I had no enough information to write about. Then I started to think about the common technology which are everyday around us. Cellphone came to my mind. I decided to write about cellphone's bad influence on in-person communication. I admit it is not a very easy topic to write because a lot of people will think I am wrong and cellphones are all good. But I want to give me a try. </P>

<h3>#6. Continue on Cultural Analysis</h3>
<p> After drafting, the real work began. It's actually not that hard for me to write the essay after I did the draft. Because my mind was super clear after having the draft. I know where to put what. All I need to do was to translate the information that I found into my own words for audience. It took me quite a while to read and collect information but I enjoyed knowledge I learnt from this progress. I started to have confidence on my topic and I really now think cellphone can have a bad effect on face-to-face communication. </P>

<h3>#7. Formal Research Project</h3>
<p>The first thing I saw on the worksheet was that I have to write three thousand word for this formal research paper. Why each project is getting harder and harder for me! I didn’t know if I could finish this project well but I knew it would take me a lot of time to do it. Professor gave us a website to use for us to collecting resources. It's the e-library of MSU. I never used this website before until professor gave it to me. I am really thankful that I got this tool because it did help me to find resources faster. All the resources I wanted to find were put into different categories and work cited. It made me easier to arrange my information of my topic.</P>

<h3>#8. Formal Research Project-Completed</h3>
<p> This research project is about my major, Physics. After finishing this research paper, I learnt a lot of thing about my major that I didn't know before. I think this is a very good assignment for a student because actually I am not writing this project for anyone, I am writing this project for myself. First year of college, I bet a lot of student like me will have a lot of concerns about their majors but they are too lazy to do research about it. This formal research project gave me a chance to not being lazy and learnt a lot about my major. Thank you professor for assigning this project.</P>

<h3> #9. Eminem Commercial </h3>
This commercial is about Chrysler 300. I think the producers did a very good job on this advertisement. It relates Chrysler 300 with Detroit city very well. It gives people a passion about the city and the car. The scenes of Detroit was very important because it catches audiences' eyes and makes them wonder what will happen next. Eminem is the most important role in this commercial. Eminem is a good representative of the city since we all know he comes from Detroit. After showing the scenes of Eminem who is representing Detroit driving the Chrysler 300, it brings this commercial to its climax. This commercial gives people positive energy and brings people a new aspect of the city. </p>

<h3>#10. Codecademy</h3>
I didn't know that Codecademy will be a part of the grade until today. I thought it was just a website professor gave to us to help us learn html. Log into the Codecademy, what I had was 30% done. I was kind of upset when saw it because I thought I did more than 30%. I decided to finish it in one day. Most of the things in the program was very easy. What I need to do was follow the hint step by step. But some of the question were very tricky. Without the hint, I had to try several time to finish them. It made me so mad that I needed to redo some simple questions again and again because I missed a simple dot or dash carelessly.

<h3> #11. Multimodal Remix Project Remix</h3>
Since Fatin, Joshua and I are friends, we decide to do this project together. This multimodal remix project was different from the last projects. I have to finish this project in a group. It's a group thing. I am so glad that I can work with Fatin and Joshua. Other special thing about this project is that we need to do a documentary about a topic which we have had written before. It's cool to do our own documentary but I am still nervous about this weird project. I never video type on purpose before. None of us know what to do. We decide to have a group meeting later to talk about this project and finish the proposal first. 
<p>11-18-13</p>
<h3>#12. Group Meeting</h3>
<p>I like the group meeting because it will help people to figure thing out. It's fruitful for having this meeting. We finished the proposal and decided to do a documentary on how cellphones affect people's in-person communication. I was so happy that my group chose the documentary topic from my recent project. We did feel that the proposal   was super hard to write. A lot of questions on the proposal were kind of complex for us to answer. It's good for us to have three member in our group. Because tie situation would never happen in this group. After finishing the proposal, we all felt tired out. </p>

<h3>#13. Another Group Meeting</h3>
This time we were having a meeting for video typing a short film for our documentary. We decided to do it before Thank giving since no one was going to be able to work during the break. This was the first time I was being in a short film. Although I had watched thousands of movies for my life, I did not have any skill on acting. I had to admit that I am a bod actor. I couldn't stop laughing during the practice and my face looked so fake in the short film. After this group meeting, my dream of being an actor was totally crashed.

<h3>#14. Course Retrospective project</h3>
<p> Course Retrospective project is project needs us to writing about a reflection of the WRA class. This project can help the student who is going to take WRA next year get to know this class better and to be prepared before taking this class. I like doing this project because it reminds me a lot of memories from this year! </p>
<p>12-5-13</p>
<h3>#15 Last day of the class</h3>
<p> In this class, I learnt a lot thing about writing. I learnt how to make a website; I learnt how to write a research paper; I learnt how to video type a short film and make a short documentary. I think I had a good semester in this class. I made two friends Fatin and Joshua in this Class. I think WRA is fruitful for me. Last but not least, Merry Christmas!!!</p>
